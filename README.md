# Campaigns REST API 
This is a simple example how you can use spring boot + mongodb + docker to create MongoDB

- [x] Spring Boot
- [x] Spring Data
- [x] MongoDB 
- [x] Log4j2 (instead of logback)
- [x] Docker
- [x] Swagger 2 (api documentation)
- [x] Unit Tests
- [x] Integration Tests

**System requirements**
- JDK 11
- Maven
- Docker

## API documentation 
This example uses Swagger http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to check the documentation.

## Build and run application
The file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) contains all the necessary settings to configure  the rest api and the database. If you want to  build or rebuild services to include any code changes in the docker image(s).

Enjoy!
